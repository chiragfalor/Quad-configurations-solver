Dear Chirag,

Here are models as you requested.  You did not specify the position
of the source, so it is always the same, close to the lens but
far enough away for 2-5% variations.  Since these are perfect
models, and since your solutions are perfect, they should agree
to 7 or 16 decimal places.

I did not look carefully at the outputs, but I suspect most
of them will be OK.

-PLS

Call this cf5:
> xg, yg at origin, zero shear. some ellipticity, and varying potential
> angles (for ellipticity)
A: PA = 0
B: PA = 10
C: PA = 45
D: PA = 80

Call this cf6:
> xg, yg at origin, zero position angle. some ellipticity and varying
> shear
A: PA = 0
B: PA = 10
C: PA = 45
D: PA = 80

Call ths cf7:
> zero shear, zero position angle. some ellipticity, varying xg, yg

A: xg = 0.00 ; yg =  0.03
B: xg = 0.03 ; yg =  0.00
C: xg = 0.03 ; yg =  0.03
D: xg = 0.00 ; yg = -0.03
